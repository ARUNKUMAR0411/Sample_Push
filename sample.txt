This file content is added after pushing the file to remote repository and below are the steps followed
1. git init
2. git add "sample.txt"
3. git commit -m "first commit"
4. git remote add origin "https://github.com/ARUNKUMAR0411/Sample_Push.git"

/* created a new branch master */

CHECKOUT:
Updating the document with checkout to new branch steps

	1.git checkout -b "New_repo_cmd"

this will create a new repository 

also a local copy for the existing pulled file in local repostiroy will be created internally
the edit made under the same pulled file is a copy of pulled one and not the pulled file.

Now it is switched to new branch "New_repo_cmd" so when u push this sample.txt file it will be uploaded in the new repo
